<p>Link Recommender for Drupal 7</p>

<p>Upon submission of a node, searches the database for title matches that might make for useful links. Provides a list of suggested links back to the just-submitted node, and automatically creates links upon user approval. Very helpful for the NCpedia project (http://ncpedia.org), perhaps for similar projects as well.</p>

<p><strong>Still very much in beta. Back up your database before installing or using.</strong></p>

<p>To-dos:
*Generalize code for easier adoption by other projects (kind of grew up organically, still has the NCpedia label)
*Improve link context
*More robust search options/administrative control
*Lots more testing</p>
